Adds custom filtering to the orders screen to allow filtering by coupon used.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a new filtering option to the orders screen. This allows you to filter your orders by the coupon used within the order.

> **Requires: WooCommerce 2.2+**, Compatible with WooCommerce 2.3 and 2.4

**There are no settings**. The plugin will add the filtering dropdown automatically to the "Orders" screen while active.

= Fast Coupon Filtering =
While you can search for the coupon used, this isn't ideal to find orders that have used a coupon, as you may have product names that contain the coupon name. This plugin adds a filtering option to return exact results for orders that have used a particular coupon.

Only coupons that are "published" (no drafts) will be available in the filtering dropdown.

== Installation ==

1. Be sure you're running WooCommerce 2.2+ in your shop.
2. Upload the entire `woocommerce-filter-orders-by-coupon` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or upload the .zip file with the plugin under **Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload**
3. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress

You can now filter your orders by coupons available in your shop by visiting **WooCommerce &gt; Orders** in your admin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why don't all of my coupons show up in the dropdown? =
Only coupons with a status of "published" will be shown here. If your coupon is set up as draft, it won't be used for filtering.

= I don't see a dropdown at all! What gives? =
The coupon filtering dropdown will only show if coupons are present in your shop and published :).

= Can I filter for orders that have used more than one coupon? =
Sorry, this functionality isn't available. This plugin is simply meant to be an easy way to check for orders that contain a particular coupon. If an order uses more than one coupon, it will still be included when filtering, so long as the coupon you're filtering for was used.

= Can I translate this in my language? =
Yep! There's only one string to translate, but you can do so :). The coupon names are pulled directly from your coupon list, so they can be translated there.

The text domain to use is `wc-filter-orders`.
